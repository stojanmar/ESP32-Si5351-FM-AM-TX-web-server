# ESP32-Si5351-FM-AM-TX-web-server
ESP32 with Si5351 and web server to build a low power Transmitter with AM and FM.
This project allows to build an low power Transmitter actually a FVO with AM and FM modulation. First inspiration came from the need for an RF signal generator to be used in laboratory with HAM radios.
It would allow to experiment with radios and tune them properly. For conveniant usage it can be placed at any corner in the lab or even other houce places where the WiFi is provided.
Since it includes teh Web server all the controll can be managed by connecting smart fhones to its IP adress, simply using the ordinarry browser.
To use it in Arduino IDE you have to replace the Si5351Arduino library with my ....... library which will provide also the FM modulation on popular Si5351.
